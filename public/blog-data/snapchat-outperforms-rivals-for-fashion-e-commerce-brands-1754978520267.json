  "content": "# Snapchat Outperforms Rivals for Fashion E-commerce Brands\n\n## Introduction\n\nIf you’re in the fashion and beauty social-media game, you probably spend a lot of time deciding where to put ad dollars. Instagram and TikTok feel like default choices for trend-driven creatives, but recent industry research is forcing brands to reconsider an underrated contender: Snapchat. In 2025, a string of studies and campaign experiments revealed that Snapchat—long thought of as simply a messaging app for teens—has quietly become one of the most efficient platforms for fashion e-commerce, especially when the goal is to reach Gen Z shoppers with strong return on ad spend (ROAS).\n\nThe evidence is hard to ignore. A May 2025 study conducted by Triple Whale and commissioned by Snapchat analyzed roughly 20,000 e-commerce advertisers and a combined ad spend of $3 billion across multiple platforms. The headline result: Snapchat delivered a 7.5% improvement in ROAS at a time when most platforms were seeing declines, and it posted the lowest cost per acquisition (CPA) among the platforms compared. Fashion and apparel advertisers in particular delivered the highest ROAS—an important note for apparel brands operating on slim margins and constantly chasing trend windows.\n\nBut it’s not just performance numbers. Snapchat’s product stack—AR try-ons, visual search, creator-driven lenses, and Promoted Places—maps very well to how Gen Z wants to discover, evaluate, and buy clothes. Snapchat’s own research and third-party surveys (including work with Publicis Media and NRG) show that Snapchatters are highly social while shopping: 92% of daily Snapchat users include friends in their shopping journey, and more than half actively send messages or pictures during shopping. Visual search matters too: 77% of Snapchatters report that visual search helps them find apparel items faster and easier (versus only 50% of non-Snapchatters). Combine that behavior with a platform that emphasizes ephemeral, visual-first storytelling and you have a convergence of product, audience, and ad performance.\n\nThis post unpacks why Snapchat is emerging as the unexpected champion for fashion brands targeting Gen Z, dives into the data and real-world examples (including American Eagle’s July 2025 Snap Map campaign), and gives practical advice for brands that want to test or scale Snapchat advertising. Expect a mix of hard figures, strategic analysis, creative direction, and actionable takeaways you can use in your next campaign planning session.\n\n## Understanding Snapchat’s Advantage for Fashion Brands\n\nSnapchat’s advantage starts with audience and behavior. The platform is densest with younger users—Gen Z—and their shopping habits and discovery behaviors are different from older cohorts. Gen Z values immediacy, authenticity, and social validation; they prefer real-time feedback from peers and they shop through dialogue and visuals rather than static product pages. Snapchat’s product design—short-lived Stories, AR lenses, and direct friend-to-friend sharing—mirrors that behavior and makes it uniquely well-suited to fashion e-commerce.\n\nConsider the Triple Whale study from May 2025 that benchmarked performance across roughly 20,000 e-commerce advertisers with $3 billion in ad spend. Snapchat showed a 7.5% improvement in ROAS while other platforms were reporting declines. Importantly, Snapchat also recorded the lowest CPA in the analysis. For fashion brands, where the cost of returns and customer acquisition can quickly eat margins, lower CPA and higher ROAS are more than vanity metrics—they’re operationally meaningful.\n\nComplementing those performance metrics are Snapchat’s consumer-behavior insights. Snapchat’s Generation Report and a broader set of surveys run with Publicis Media and NRG (covering 3,000 apparel shoppers across markets such as the US, UK, Canada, Saudi Arabia, and France) found strong behaviors that favor social-visual discovery. Data points include:\n- 92% of daily Snapchatters include their friends in their shopping journey.\n- Over 50% of Snapchatters actively send messages or pictures during shopping.\n- 77% of Snapchatters agree that visual search helps them find apparel items faster and easier, compared with only 50% of non-Snapchatters.\n- Over 80% of Snapchatters say social media is a primary way they keep up with fashion trends.\n\nThese numbers matter for creative strategy. Visual search and AR try-ons reduce friction in the evaluation stage—helping shoppers move from inspiration to purchase without multiple external searches or in-store visits. The social element—sharing screenshots, sending Lenses, or tagging friends—drives organic reach and creates social proof at no extra media cost.\n\nAnother important piece is how Snapchat converts both online and offline intent. Q2 2025 GWI Moments data showed that 95% of U.S. Snapchat users planned to shop in physical stores for back-to-school purchases. That demonstrates Snapchat’s capacity to drive foot traffic as well as e-commerce purchases—critical for omnichannel brands that measure success in both digital revenue and in-store lift.\n\nFinally, Snapchat’s ad products are evolving rapidly. Promoted Places (Snap Map pins that surface store locations, creator content, and direct shopping links), AR try-on Lenses, and visual search capabilities make it easier for brands to create interactive, shoppable experiences. American Eagle’s July 2025 campaign, which used Promoted Places on more than 800 store locations and included a planned AR try-on Lens for jeans, is a clear example of how the platform supports integrated, cross-channel retail strategies.\n\n## Key Components and Analysis\n\nLet’s break down the elements that drive Snapchat’s superior performance for fashion e-commerce: audience alignment, product features, creative language, and measurement.\n\nAudience alignment\n- Demographics: Snapchat still skews young, with a heavy concentration of Gen Z and younger millennials—groups that are both trend-sensitive and high-frequency social shoppers.\n- Social shopping behavior: The platform is inherently social. With 92% of daily Snapchatters involving friends in their shopping journey, Snapchat serves both as discovery and a low-friction consultation channel—friends can send photos, reactions, and short videos to validate purchases instantly.\nAnalysis: This social validation loop shortens the consideration window. If a user can see a Lens of a new hoodie, send it to friends, get instant approval, and click to buy—all without leaving the app—conversion velocity increases.\n\nProduct features and UX\n- AR Lenses and try-ons: AR reduces hesitation by letting users visualize fit, color, and style. Lenses have shown strong engagement because they’re interactive and shareable.\n- Visual search: The research with Publicis Media and NRG found 77% of Snapchatters felt visual search made it easier to find apparel. Visual search cuts search friction and decreases the number of touchpoints from inspiration to product page.\n- Promoted Places and Snap Map: The American Eagle example (July 2025) used Promoted Places across 800+ stores, letting users tap a pin, view creator content, and go to the retailer’s site. This bridges discovery and physical retail.\nAnalysis: These features are complementary—visual search and AR accelerate evaluation, Promoted Places and map integrations drive local discovery, and social sharing amplifies reach organically.\n\nCreative language that converts\n- Visual-first ad formats: Snapchat favors motion, quick edits, and creator-led authenticity over glossy, static product shots. Fashion creatives that lean into storytelling—how something looks on a real person, how it moves, how it pairs—perform better than staged catalog imagery.\n- Creator partnerships: Partnering with Snapchat-native creators who understand the platform’s cadence leads to creative that looks, feels, and performs like native content instead of an interruption.\nAnalysis: The Triple Whale data shows higher ROAS for fashion/apparel advertisers—this is a creative match. Brands that adapt to Snapchat’s language (ephemeral, authentic, peer-like) get better performance.\n\nMeasurement and economics\n- ROAS and CPA: Triple Whale’s May 2025 analysis (20,000 advertisers, $3B ad spend) found Snapchat’s 7.5% ROAS improvement and lowest CPA across platforms. Anthony DelPizzo, Director of Product Marketing at Triple Whale, emphasized efficiency: \"It's critical advertisers pay close attention to efficiency in today's ever-evolving landscape. Snapchat's 7.5% improvement makes it a standout opportunity.\"\n- Omnichannel effects: GWI Q2 2025 data showing 95% of U.S. Snapchat users planning to shop in-store for back-to-school demonstrates lift beyond purely digital conversions.\nAnalysis: These metrics suggest Snapchat can lower acquisition costs while preserving or increasing order value—especially valuable for apparel brands contending with returns and tight margins.\n\n## Practical Applications\n\nHow do fashion brands put this to work? Below are practical strategies and campaign frameworks that leverage Snapchat’s strengths to reach Gen Z shoppers and maximize fashion ROAS.\n\n1) Start with discovery-first creative\n- Use short, visually punchy vertical content with the product in motion. Show fit, fabric, and context (e.g., a day-to-night outfit transition).\n- Prioritize creator-style authenticity: creators wearing the product, reacting naturally, and giving sizing tips.\n- Test UGC versus studio content. On Snapchat, UGC-inspired creative often outperforms glossy ads because it aligns with user expectations.\n\n2) Layer AR and visual search to reduce friction\n- Integrate AR try-on Lenses for key SKUs (jeans, sunglasses, makeup). The American Eagle July 2025 rollout included an AR try-on for jeans—this kind of interactivity nudges users from consideration to purchase.\n- Use visual search tagging in organic and paid posts to help shoppers find exact or similar items quickly. Given that 77% of Snapchatters find visual search helpful, this reduces search abandonment.\n\n3) Use Promoted Places for omnichannel activation\n- If you have brick-and-mortar stores, map them on Snap Map using Promoted Places to drive visits. American Eagle’s expanded Promoted Places across 800 stores is a playbook example.\n- Link map pins to store-specific content—inventory, creator videos filmed in-store, and direct-to-cart links for local pick-up.\n\n4) Make social sharing part of the funnel\n- Create Lenses or filters designed to be shared with friends (“Which jacket suits me?”). Encourage tagging to generate organic reach.\n- Offer incentives for friend invitations—discounts or early access when users share a product via Snapchat.\n\n5) Optimize for efficiency, measure incrementally\n- Track ROAS and CPA by creative variant and placement. The Triple Whale study underscores the importance of efficiency; prioritize ad sets that show low CPA and high purchase rate.\n- Test small pockets of spend across UGC, creator collaborations, and AR experiences. Scale the combinations that drive the best fashion ROAS.\n\n6) Pair with other channels—but don’t dilute creative\n- Use Snapchat for discovery and validation, then retarget on search or email for direct-cart recovery. Keep creative consistent across platforms but tailored to each channel’s expectations (ephemeral vs. polished).\n- Use first-party data and pixel tracking to measure cross-channel lift. The omnichannel lift toward in-store visits (95% planning to shop in-store, Q2 2025) should be included in measurement frameworks.\n\nActionable campaign example\n- Objective: Increase denim sales among Gen Z in back-to-school season.\n- Tactics: 1) Launch AR try-on Lens showing 3 fits; 2) Run short-form creator videos (10-15s) showing outfit transitions; 3) Add Promoted Places for stores with eligible inventory; 4) Deploy a visual-search tag so users can snap a photo and get product matches; 5) Retarget engaged users with limited-time discount via Snap Ads.\n- Measurement: Track CPA, ROAS, and in-store visits. Use incremental tests to compare AR-enabled audiences vs. standard video-only audiences.\n\n## Challenges and Solutions\n\nSnapchat’s rise in fashion ROAS doesn’t mean it’s a silver bullet. Brands must understand common pitfalls and how to address them.\n\nChallenge 1: Smaller reach compared to giants\n- Issue: Snapchat’s audience is big in Gen Z but smaller in older demos. Brands wanting broad-market reach may find Instagram and TikTok have larger absolute audience sizes.\n- Solution: Use Snapchat as a performance channel focused on Gen Z segments while maintaining other platforms for broader reach. Use cross-channel attribution to understand net-new customer acquisition rather than duplicating spend blindly.\n\nChallenge 2: Creative expectations differ\n- Issue: Snapchat users expect native, authentic, and ephemeral content. Stiff, overly produced assets often underperform.\n- Solution: Work with Snapchat-native creators and production partners to produce content that “feels” native. Test UGC formats and iterate quickly. Ensure assets are vertical, fast, and social-first.\n\nChallenge 3: Measurement complexity for omnichannel campaigns\n- Issue: Connecting online ad spend to in-store visits and long-tail lifetime value can be tricky.\n- Solution: Implement measurement partners and robust tracking (pixels, incrementality tests). Promoted Places and store-level landing pages make it easier to attribute foot traffic to specific ad prompts. Also, consider working with partners like Triple Whale or using Snapchat’s own measurement solutions to verify ROAS and CPA.\n\nChallenge 4: High expectations for AR and technical execution\n- Issue: Developing AR Lenses and high-quality visual search experiences can be resource-intensive.\n- Solution: Start with a single, high-impact Lens (e.g., top-selling sunglasses or signature jeans) and iterate. Use Snap’s Lens Studio templates or partner with AR agencies. Focus on conversion KPIs to justify further investment.\n\nChallenge 5: Creative fatigue and frequency\n- Issue: Snapchat’s ephemeral nature can lead to faster creative fatigue, requiring more creative refreshes.\n- Solution: Build a content calendar with frequent micro-tests. Repurpose creator content into multiple variants. Use dynamic creative optimization where possible to automate refreshes based on performance data.\n\nThe bottom line: the challenges are real but solvable. The performance upside shown in the May 2025 Triple Whale study—7.5% ROAS improvement and lowest CPA—suggests the problem is not platform efficacy but thoughtful execution. Brands that adapt creative, measurement, and operational workflows to Snapchat’s rhythm will capture disproportionate returns.\n\n## Future Outlook\n\nWhere does Snapchat go from here, and what should fashion brands expect in 2026 and beyond? Multiple signals point to continued relevance and growth for fashion-focused social commerce on Snapchat.\n\n1) Continued investment in AR and visual search\n- Snapchat has doubled down on AR capabilities, and brands like American Eagle are pioneering store-level AR integrations. Expect more advanced try-ons (improved fit simulations, cloth physics) and deeper visual search integration that surfaces exact product matches and commerce links. With 77% of Snapchatters already valuing visual search for apparel, incremental improvements will further reduce friction.\n\n2) Stronger omnichannel integrations\n- Promoted Places and Snap Map activations will become more common as retailers seek to bridge online campaigns with in-store traffic. The American Eagle July 2025 campaign—promoting over 800 stores—serves as an early template for scaling localized, commerce-driven content that feeds both e-commerce and brick-and-mortar.\n\n3) Social commerce maturation\n- Social commerce is shifting from novelty to a core channel. Over 80% of Snapchatters say social media is a primary method for keeping up with fashion trends. Expect native checkout flows to mature, influencer commerce deals to become more measurable, and attribution solutions to better quantify long-term value rather than only first-click conversions.\n\n4) Gen Z shopping behavior will continue to shape platform roadmaps\n- Gen Z’s preferences for immediacy, social validation, and visual-first discovery will push platforms like Snapchat to evolve features that emphasize instant purchase options, better peer-sharing tools, and tools that reduce returns (more accurate AR fit, clearer size guides).\n\n5) Economic efficiency will remain crucial\n- As brands chase profitability, platforms that deliver lower CPA and higher ROAS—like Snapchat in the Triple Whale analysis—will attract more ad dollars. Expect more apparel advertisers to test and scale Snapchat campaigns in pursuit of sustainable fashion ROAS.\n\n6) Global expansion of best practices\n- The Publicis Media and NRG surveys across markets like the United Kingdom, Canada, Saudi Arabia, and France show that Snapchat’s strengths aren’t limited to the U.S. As local Snap product teams expand regional ad tools and creator networks, global apparel brands will find replicable templates for market-specific campaigns.\n\nStrategic implication: Brands that invest now in Snapchat-first creative playbooks, AR assets, and localized Promoted Places strategies will be well-positioned to capture a larger share of Gen Z wallet share as social commerce continues to grow. The macro apparel market supports this: global apparel revenue is projected to reach $2 trillion by 2029, and one-third of apparel sales are expected to occur online by 2027. Snapchat’s combination of high-efficiency ad performance and features designed for visual commerce means it can capture a meaningful slice of that online growth—especially among younger buyers.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSnapchat’s recent performance—demonstrated by a May 2025 Triple Whale study of 20,000 advertisers and $3 billion in ad spend—shows the platform is more than a messaging app for teenagers: it’s a highly efficient channel for fashion e-commerce. With a 7.5% improvement in ROAS and the lowest CPA among compared platforms, Snapchat offers measurable financial advantages. Add consumer behaviors (92% of daily Snapchatters include friends in shopping journeys; over 50% share photos while shopping; 77% say visual search helps them find apparel faster; over 80% use social media to track trends), and you have a platform whose product features—AR try-ons, visual search, Promoted Places—map precisely to Gen Z shopping needs.\n\nAmerican Eagle’s July 2025 campaign—using Promoted Places across 800+ stores and an AR try-on Lens rollout—illustrates how brands can blend discovery, social validation, and omnichannel execution. The data from Q2 2025 also shows that Snapchat can drive offline behavior (95% of U.S. Snapchat users planned to shop in physical stores for back-to-school), proving that Snapchat’s impact isn’t limited to in-app conversions.\n\nFor fashion and beauty brands targeting Gen Z, the prescription is clear: test Snapchat intentionally, craft native creative, integrate AR and visual search, and measure efficiency through ROAS and CPA. Use Snapchat as a performance-first platform for younger segments while maintaining broader-reach platforms for older demographics. With global apparel revenue projected to hit $2 trillion by 2029 and online apparel sales expected to represent one-third by 2027, platforms that combine visual storytelling, social commerce, and cost efficiency will win.\n\nActionable takeaways recap:\n- Prioritize Snapchat for Gen Z-targeted campaigns—its audience and ad features drive higher fashion ROAS.\n- Invest in AR try-ons and visual search to reduce purchase friction (77% of Snapchatters find visual search faster and easier).\n- Use Promoted Places and Snap Map for omnichannel activation—American Eagle’s July 2025 rollout is a strong case study.\n- Work with Snapchat-native creators and UGC-style creative to match platform expectations and lower CPA.\n- Measure incrementally—track ROAS, CPA, and in-store lift to validate and scale winning tactics.\n\nSnapchat is no longer an experimental channel for fashion brands; with the right creative and measurement playbook, it’s a performance engine that outperforms rivals for Gen Z shopping behavior and fashion ROAS.",
